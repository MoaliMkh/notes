    "In previous lectures, we discussed situations in which we had only a single agent. We didn't consider other parameters affecting our environment but in this chapter, a new type of search is introduced which is called **Adversarial Search**. In adversarial search, we define our problem in a multi-agent context. For instance, while playing a game, our agent has to consider the other agent's moves (adversarial moves) to play in an efficient way. Even in some games we can define a winning stategy which means we can guarantee that in every state of our game, no matter how bad it is, our agent is able to win the game.\n",

    "Briefly, Game Theory is designing the strategies and the steps of our player to interact in the best way, according to the rival's steps and strategies. In other words, Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions among rational decision-makers.\n",
    "To achieve this goal, we need to express our game and its rules and actions in a mathematical form. The common model used to represent games is the model below:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>States of the game: $S_i$, starting with $S_0$</li>\n",
    "Which means how the game will look after each action of competitors.\n",
    "    <li>Players: P = {1,2,...,n}</li>\n",
    "represents number of agents playing the game which varies from 1 to n.\n",
    "    <li>Actions: $A_i$</li>\n",
    "In every state, each player has a set of legitimate moves to change that state to another state by playing its turn.\n",
    "    <li>Transition functions: S x A -> S</li>\n",
    "Transition function is a function which takes a state S, and does the action A to that state, and returns another state which is built as a consequence of that action.\n",
    "    <li>Terminal tests: S -> {True, False}</li>\n",
    "It is a boolean function which determines whether our game has reached a final state or not.\n",
    "    <li>Terminal utilities: S ✕ P -> R </li>\n",
    "It takes a state S, and a player P, and returns a Real number which indicates the score of the player P (The utility of the P, to be more precise) till that moment.\n",
    "    <li> Policy/Strategy: S -> A </li>\n",
    "The Policy is the strategy defined by our AI program. It takes a state S, and according to the program, does action A which is the best action for that situation. \n",

    "Before we discuss types of games, we need to define a concept named **Utility Function** first. Each player has some states that will be more willing in them. For example, if the player P has a State S which is more satisfied in it, this means that P has better moves in S toward the goal state and is able to win the game more easily. So each player has a utility function which indicates that in every state, how satisfied the player is and what is the best result that it can score, starting with that state. Naturally in goal states, which the game has been finished, the utility function is maximum for the player.\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Zero-Sum games</li>\n",
    "    In Zero-Sum games, the sum of utility functions for all the agents is equal to zero. For instance, in a two-agent game, if the player P1 has the utility finction with the value of 10 in an specific state, the player P2 has a utility function with the value -10 in that state. So this game becomes totally adversarial and competetive in a way that we have a single value for utility function and one of the players wants to maximize that value and another one wants to minimize it.\n",
    "    <li>General games</li>\n",
    "    In this type of games, each of the agents has its own utility function. These utility functions may be independant, so in some stages of the game, the agents may even have to cooperate in addition to competing and indifferenting to increase their own utility function value. This type of the game is more general and also complicated compared to Zero-Sum games.\n",

Starting from an initial state, our agent can either move to left or right. based on this, and its following moves, we can form a tree called **Single Agent Tree**. Each node of this tree indicates an state of the game and the utility function has an specific value in every one of them. We call the leaves of the tree **The Terminal Nodes**. In these terminal nodes, the game is finshed and the utility values are defined. The main question is how can we obtain the utility value of a node? According on what's been said, we have the utility values of the leaves. Recursively, to get the utility value of a node N, we calculate the utility value of every successor of N and we choose the maximum of those numbers as the utility value of the node N.\n",

    "Like Single Agent Trees, we can form a tree to express the moves of the agents, but the differnce is that at each level of the tree, only one agent can play. For example if we start with the player P1 at the root of the tree, based on its move, we gain 2 successors and we go to the first level of the tree. At this level of tree, only the other player called P2 can move and each of the 2 nodes will have 2 successors based on P2's move. So we have 4 nodes in the second level and the game will continue this way till the end. In this Configuration, how can we calculate the utility value of nodes? This will be our next topic.  "

    "Before this, we only discussed games with a single player. But we use Adversarial search when there are other players and agents in the game too, often with opposite objectives. With adversarial search, we are seeking a method called **Playing Strategy** that gives us correct directions and instructions at each state of game.\n",
    "\n",
    "We classified games in two main groups based on utility functions:\n",
    "- Zero-Sum Games: The sum of agents' utility functions is equal to zero. (pure competition)\n",
    "- General Games:  independent utility functions. (cooperation may be beneficial)\n",
    "\n",
    "We formed trees for both single and adversarial agent games and we found a strategy to obtain the value of nodes in both situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal strategy against an opponent playing perfectly can be found using **Minimax strategy**. We can also determine a floor value of the score that can be achieved in every game.\n",
    "A complete search is often impossible in minimax because of resource limits. So There are two options:\n",
    "- Replace the utility function with an **Evaluation Function** that estimates utility. This function must be defined very precise, because the whole solution depends on this.\n",
    "- Do **Minimax Pruning**: While calculating minimax values, it's sometimes possible to detect and **prune** some suboptimal branches that we know we'll never visit them during the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another point that has to be considered is that While we are looking for a good strategy of playing, we must neighter act Optimistically nor Pessimismtically, because they can both result in suboptimal behaviour so it's important to evaluate each problem realistically and choose our strategy in proportion of the adversarial agent's cleverness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertain factors (like rolling dice) are represented by Expectation Nodes in a game tree. Optimal strategy in such games can be found using **Expectimax Search** which was explained before."
