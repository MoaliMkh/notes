    "### The concept of adversarial search and an introduction to Game Theory\n",
    "In previous lectures, we discussed situations in which we had only a single agent. We didn't consider other parameters affecting our environment but in this chapter, a new type of search is introduced which is called **Adversarial Search**. In adversarial search, we define our problem in a multi-agent context. For instance, while playing a game, our agent has to consider the other agent's moves (adversarial moves) to play in an efficient way. Even in some games we can define a winning stategy which means we can guarantee that in every state of our game, no matter how bad it is, our agent is able to win the game.\n",
